<h1>Welcome to CEDU</h1>
<p><strong>This page is still being worked on, please don't expect too much TwT</strong></p>
<h3>What's CEDU?</h3>
<p>Well as some of you may (or may not) know, I have some coding knowledge, and it is no good if only I can use it, so in here I will and am document(ing) my development journey with guides and solutions to the problems you might get while developing code or trying to debug some server stuff.</p>
<h3>Who operates it?</h3>
<p>Just me myself and I. Currently I have noone who could also write guides in here, but it's fine :3</p>
