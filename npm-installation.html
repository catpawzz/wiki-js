<h1>How to use NGINX proxy manager</h1>
<p><strong>In this guide you'll learn how to install NPM on your machine! </strong>This deployment uses docker, so if you don't have it installed, please check out the guide on how to install it!</p>
<h3>1- What is a proxy, and what good is NPM for?</h3>
<p>A <strong>proxy</strong> acts as an intermediary between a client and a server, facilitating communication by forwarding requests and responses between them. There are two main types:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Forward Proxy</strong>: This type sits in front of the client and forwards requests to the server on behalf of the client. It's often used for privacy, security, or content filtering.</li>
  <li><strong>Reverse Proxy</strong>: This sits in front of the server and forwards requests from clients to different servers. It's commonly used for load balancing, security, and caching.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Nginx Proxy Manager (NPM)</strong> is a convenient, web-based interface for managing reverse proxies with Nginx. It simplifies the process of configuring proxy servers by allowing users to manage:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>SSL certificates</strong> for secure connections</li>
  <li><strong>Load balancing</strong> to distribute traffic across multiple servers</li>
  <li><strong>Access control</strong> and security rules</li>
  <li><strong>Redirection and caching</strong> for efficient traffic management</li>
</ul>
<p>In essence, NPM provides a user-friendly way to implement reverse proxies, making it easier to manage web traffic and server resources while improving security and performance.</p>
